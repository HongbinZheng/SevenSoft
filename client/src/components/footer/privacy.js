          applications (“apps”); by enrolling in one of our customer loyalty or

          <p>DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We define the term “personal information” to mean any information that
          we directly associate with, or use to identify, a specific person.
          This may include information such as an address, phone number, email
          address, or fax number; a user name or other online registration
          information; a financial account or credit card number, and
          transaction information or purchase history, when associated with a
          person’s name. Personal information does not include “aggregated
          information,” which is information that we collect about a group or
          category of persons or services. It also does not include
          “de-identified information,” which is information from which we or our
          agents have removed any information that can be used to specifically
          identify a person. This policy does not restrict or limit our
          collection, use, or disclosure of aggregated or de-identified
          information.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <p>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may collect your personal and other information described below in
          various ways, including, but not limited to, the following:
        </p>

        <p>
          *Personal Information You Provide. We may request, or give you the
          opportunity to provide, personal information when you register as a
          user of our website or one of our mobile applications, shop online or
          in our stores, sign up for our programs, offers, or sweepstakes, take
          one of our surveys, use our products or services, cash a check,
          contact us about a prior purchase, or email, call, or otherwise
          communicate with us. Similarly, if you contact us regarding a product
          or service that you are interested in or concerned about, we may
          request that you provide personal information that will enable us to
          respond to your inquiry.*Automatically Collected Information. When you
          shop online or in our stores or register for or use any of our online,
          mobile or other services, transactional and other information, such as
          the date of your purchase, registration, or service usage, their
          descriptions and, if applicable, the dollar amount or value of the
          transaction, your Internet protocol address, browser type, domain
          names, access times, operating systems, mouse clicks and movements,
          and scrolling activities may be collected automatically or “passively”
          by us or by one or more of our third party service providers. For
          example, we may use third-party analytics tools that collect
          information about use of our websites and user traffic. We treat this
          information as personal information if we combine it with or link it
          to other information that may identify you.*Location Information. If
          you use one of our mobile applications and your mobile device’s
          settings allow it, we may collect information about your real-time
          location. You may adjust the settings on your mobile device to allow
          or prevent the sharing of location information. For example, you can
          disable “Location” (or “Location Services” on iOS-based devices) on
          your mobile device to prevent sharing your location information with
          us. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service
          provider or the manufacturer of your mobile device to learn how to
          adjust your mobile device settings. Please note that if you disable
          the sharing of location information, you may be unable to access some
          features of our services that are designed for mobile devices.*Mobile
          Device Information. We may also collect mobile device information
          using beaconing technology, such as: the device type, model and
          operating system version, and current IP address. We do not use this
          technology to collect personal information such as name, mobile
          telephone number, or email address. To disable our ability to identify
          your mobile device, you can delete our app, adjust the in-app
          settings, or turn your Bluetooth to “off” on your device.*Other
          Information. We may obtain information about you from third parties
          such as demographic marketing information, address verification, or
          mailing list information and combine it with other personal
          information pertaining to you.*Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar
          Technologies. We may use service providers to host or provide content
          on some of our websites. We and/or a service provider may use cookies,
          web beacons, Uniform Resource Locators (URL), and similar technologies
          to manage our websites and email messages and to collect and track
          information about you and your activities online at our websites over
          time and across third-party websites or online services including, but
          not limited to, your computer’s Internet protocol address and
          operating system, your browser type, the site from which you linked to
          our site, the time and date of your visit, how you use our services,
          and what products and services you purchase. In addition, we or a
          service provider may use local shared objects (or Flash cookies) to
          collect and store information about your preferences and how you
          interact with our websites and mobile applications. These technologies
          help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping
          experience, store items in your online shopping cart between visits,
          and analyze the use of our services and solutions to make them more
          useful to you. These technologies also allow us to aggregate
          demographic and statistical data and compilations of information,
          which may or may not include personal information, and provide this
          information to our service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We and/or a service provider may also link this information with other
          personal information about you and may use this linked information to
          allow third parties to serve ads on our websites or mobile
          applications or to serve our ads to you on a third party’s website or
          mobile application. If you “click through” to or otherwise visit
          third-party websites or mobile applications, they may also collect
          information about you and your visit. This Privacy Policy does not
          apply to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of other third
          parties that collect your personal information. We encourage you to
          check the privacy policies of other third parties whose information
          you find on our website to learn about their practices with respect to
          the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of your personal
          information.
